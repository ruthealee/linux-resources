# linux-resources
A variety of getting started resources for learning more about Linux in general.

The idea is to have a list of good articles or videos/courses that are jumping off points for self taught study. Hopefully some project ideas as well. 

You can also check out a small game built to help give a demo of a command line interface in one of my other [repos](https://github.com/ruthealee/hackgame)

Accepting pull requests! Add anything that might be helpful to someone new to Linux.
